# Contributing to gitwrite

Thank you for your interest in contributing. gitwrite is built for people who write seriously, and contributions that share that spirit are welcome at every level — from adding a single word to the branch name lists, to building new file type support, to improving the core daemon.

---

## Ways to contribute

### Word lists

gitwrite generates session branch names by combining one word from each of three lists in `src/words.json` — adjectives, nouns, and verbs. The result looks like `crimson-walrus-stumbling` or `teal-fox-bouncing`.

Adding words is one of the lowest-barrier contributions possible. Just open a pull request against `src/words.json`. A few guidelines:

- Keep words to one or two syllables — they read better in a branch name
- Verbs should be present participle (`-ing` form)
- Avoid words that are offensive, gendered, or culturally loaded
- Aim for words that are vivid and a little unexpected — `spatula` and `narwhal` are more interesting than `table` and `fish`

### Extensions

gitwrite is designed to be extended. See [EXTENSIONS.md](EXTENSIONS.md) for documentation on the three supported extension surfaces:

- **File type watchers** — add support for new file types beyond Markdown
- **Commit message formatters** — customize how commit messages are generated
- **Output integrations** — trigger actions after a successful push

### Bug fixes and improvements

If something is broken, open an issue first so we can align on the fix before you spend time on a pull request. For small, obvious fixes, a PR is fine directly.

### New commands or flags

The command surface is intentionally lean. Open an issue to discuss before building — we want to make sure new commands earn their place.

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TBiddy/gitwrite
cd gitwrite
npm install
```

Verify everything works:

```sh
npm test                      # run the integration test suite
node bin/gitwrite.js help     # smoke test the CLI
```

A few things worth knowing before you dig in:

- **ESM throughout** — `"type": "module"` in `package.json`, no CommonJS
- **All Git operations live in `src/git.js`** — nothing else calls `simple-git` directly
- **All display primitives live in `src/ui.js`** — nothing else calls `chalk` directly
- **All path constants live in `src/paths.js`** — nothing hardcodes `~/.gitwrite` anywhere else
- **The daemon is just `gitwrite __daemon`** — a hidden subcommand, not a separate binary; `start.js` spawns it detached

## Code style

- Keep it readable — a future contributor should be able to understand what a function does without reading the whole file
- Comment the *why*, not the *what*
- One concern per file — if a file is growing, it probably wants to be split
- Proof your CLI output — copy and terminal output are part of the product; read your output before submitting

---

## Submitting a pull request

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes
3. Run `npm test` — all tests must pass
4. Open a pull request with a clear description of what changed and why
5. If your PR changes CLI output, include a screenshot or terminal recording

---

## Opening an issue

If something is not working, please include:

- Your OS and Node.js version (`node --version`)
- The command you ran
- What you expected vs. what happened
- The output of `gitwrite logs` if the daemon was involved

## Code of conduct

Be kind. gitwrite is built for a broad audience — engineers, researchers, writers, students. Contributions and conversations should be welcoming to all of them.
